# Hotel Revenue Analysis using SQL and Power BI

## Problem
The problem is that the hotel chain is not generating as much revenue as it could be. The hotel chain’s wants to improve its marketing and sales strategies, as well as its customer service initiatives.

## Overview
This project uses SQL and Power BI to analyze data from a hotel chain. The data includes information about hotel revenue, customer type, market segment, and other factors. 

The project aims to answer the following questions:

- What is the total revenue generated from the hotels?

- How has our hotel revenue changed over the years? Is it growing or declining?

- What is the revenue breakdown by hotel type? Are there any differences in revenue growth between the two hotel types?

- What is the hotel type’s average daily rate (ADR)?

- Calculate the average discount from the hotel chain.

- Identify any seasonal trends in hotel revenue, such as peak or low seasons.

- calculates the total number of nights stayed by guests.

- Count the number of required car parking spaces.

- What is the market segment distribution revenue?

- Calculate the revenue by customer type.

- Calculate the revenue, count of required car parking spaces, and parking percentage for each arrived all year and hotel.

## Methodology
Step 1: Database Development

To start the project, I utilized Microsoft SQL Server to create a database that could accommodate the provided dataset. The data consisted of multiple years, including 2018, 2019, and 2020. Additionally, we had data on meal costs and market segments. I converted the file from Excel to CSV and imported the relevant data into the SQL database for further analysis.

Step 2: SQL Query Development

Once the database was set up, I developed SQL queries to extract the required information. This involved utilizing various SQL functions to retrieve the necessary data for analysis.

Step 3: Power BI Integration

To visualize the data and gain meaningful insights, I connected Power BI to the SQL database. This integration allowed us to create interactive and visually appealing visualizations for effective data exploration.

Step 4: Data Visualization

Using Power BI’s visualization capabilities, I created charts, graphs, and dashboards to represent the hotel data visually appealing and informatively. These visualizations enabled stakeholders to understand the patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.

## Results
Based on the analysis and visualizations, the following key findings were identified:

1. Revenue Growth: The total revenue generated from the hotels is $29,12M. Of the total revenue, 51.67% was generated by City Hotels, while Resort Hotels generated 48.33%.

2. The market segment distribution revenue shows that the Online TA market segment generates the most revenue, followed by the Direct market segment.

3. There are some seasonal trends in hotel revenue, with peak seasons being August, followed by July and September.

4. The average discount offered by the hotel chain is 25%

5. The most popular hotel type is the city hotel, which generates the most revenue.

6. The customer type distribution revenue shows that the Transient customer type generates the most revenue, followed by the Transient-Party customer type.

7. The average daily rate for hotel bookings was approximately USD 104.47, and the total number of nights used was around 368. Seasonal variations in income can be explored further to understand the impact of different periods on overall revenue.

8. Generally, guests did not require a parking area.

## Recommendation
Based on the findings of the project, the following recommendations can be made:

- The hotel chain should focus on increasing revenue from the Online TA market segment.

- The hotel chain should consider offering discounts during the off-season to attract more guests.

- The hotel chain should focus on improving the customer experience to attract more repeat customers.

## Conclusion
This project has provided valuable insights into the hotel chain’s revenue performance. The findings can be used to improve the hotel chain’s marketing and sales strategies, as well as its customer service initiatives. By implementing the recommendations, the hotel chain can increase its revenue and improve its profitability.

In addition to the recommendations above, the hotel chain may also want to consider the following:

- Conducting market research to identify new market segments that could be targeted.
- Investing in marketing and advertising to promote the hotel chain to new and existing customers.
-Improving the hotel chain’s website and online presence to make it easier for customers to book rooms and learn more about the hotel chain.
- Offering new and innovative services and amenities to attract and retain customers.
By taking these steps, the hotel chain can continue to grow its revenue and profitability in the years to come.
